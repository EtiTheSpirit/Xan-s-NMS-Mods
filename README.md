# Xan's NMS Mods
My mods for No Man's Sky.

# How to download

Open up the "Releases" folder and download the PAK files you find interest in. Descriptions of the mods will be in their corresponding folders. Be sure to delete or rename the `DISABLEMODS.TXT` file placed in the MODS directory. The MODS directory is in `..\No Man's Sky\GAMEDATA\PCBANKS\MODS`

# All mods are open source

Feel free to edit them as you desire, though be sure to credit me unless I explicitly state that I did not create the mod (e.g. it's an existing mod that I have modded again) in which case I will credit the original owner.
