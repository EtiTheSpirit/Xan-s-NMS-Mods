# Exanite Infused Lush Worlds

This mod pays tribute to the soon-closing (or if it's past 23 November 2018, *closed*) Sci-Fi MMORPG *WildStar* by Carbine Studios.

# Desciption of the changes it makes to the game

 - The color palette of all worlds flagged as Lush (Any world with extreme plant life, usually "Verdant" or "Flourishing" in planetary descriptions from the scanner) has been replaced with a very gold-heavy palette to replicate locations in WildStar that have extreme amounts of [Exanite](https://wildstar.gamepedia.com/Exanite).
 - The weather of Lush worlds has been reworked to make the boiling rainstorms / humidity a **lot** more rare.
